Framework explanation
In my framework I have automated 4 test cases. I used the Page object model, the TestNg for tests.
I have divided each web page into classes, so each page has its own class where locators are defined. also for tests,
I have created a separate class for each test.
I also created a package for common functionality, in which I included browserUtilities, Base Class, PageFactory,
 ConfigurationReader, Driver (for cross browser testing) and waits. i BasePageFactory I have used PageFactory.initElements,
 And in every Page I have extends where I have used FindBy. In BaseClass I have defined setup Method and Teardown,To close Driver
At the configuration file. I have saved data such as browser and links.
In Browser Utilities I have defined methods switch to frame ,selectBytext for Dropdowns menu.
In some cases I have created methods to wait for an element to be present on the page (using waits), ex. success() method.
In other cases,I have used javascript executor  to scroll to a particular element in the page.
To validate brokers I have used String[] arrays and I iterate to  each element with foreach loop,
 if I want to add more brokers I can Add to the Array.
In Framework faker is used to generate random data.
